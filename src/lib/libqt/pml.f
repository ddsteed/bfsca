      DOUBLE PRECISION FUNCTION PML(LX,MX,XF)
C
C     THIS SUBFUNCTION CALCULATES ASSOCIATED LEGENDRE POLYNOMIALS OF
C     ANY ORDER P SUB LX SUPER MX OF XF
C     THE ARGUMENT XF MUST BE THE ANGLE IN RADIANS
C     THE CODE USES EXPLICIT FORMULAS FOR L THROUGH 8
C     NOTE THAT FOR L GREATER THAN 4 ONLY M = 0,1,AND 2 ARE INCLUDED
C     THE RECURRENCE FORMULAS APPLY ONLY TO M = 0,1, AND 2
C     THE CONVENTIONS OF MCLEAN AND YOSHIMINE ARE USED FOR SIGNS
